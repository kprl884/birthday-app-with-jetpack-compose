💼 Jetpack Compose is Android’s modern toolkit for building native UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android. Before we used XML files for building UI but there were some issues required to develop for example Jetpack Compose has these:

😍Less code, more performance

😍Declarative UI

😍Readable ve clean code


💼 Also you can learn:

🔫Composable functions

🔫@Preview annotation

🔫3 basic standard layout elements in Compose: Row, Column, and Box

🔫Arrange the text elements in a row

🔫Add an image to your project

🔫Add Box layout

🔫Position and scale the Image composable

🔫Align the text and add padding

Also added some composable practices, you can build them if you remove command operators ( // )
